# ReactNativeDebugDemo

Originally, it's the demo project for my talk at a React.js / React Native [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/React-Singapore/events/237578363/) in April 2017. After the talk, I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@vinceyuan/react-native-debugging-tools-3a24e4e40e4) about it on Medium.

#### Steps to run

1. Clone the repo and run the server.

```
git clone git@github.com:vinceyuan/ReactNativeDebugDemo.git
cd ReactNativeDebugDemo
npm install
react-native start
```

2. In another terminal window, input `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to run the app.
