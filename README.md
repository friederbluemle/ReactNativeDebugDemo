# ReactNativeDebugDemo

Originally, it's the demo for my talk at a React Native [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/React-Singapore/events/237578363/).

####Steps to run

1. Clone the repo and run the server.

```
git clone git@github.com:vinceyuan/ReactNativeDebugDemo.git
cd ReactNativeDebugDemo
npm install
react-native start
```

2. In another terminal window, input `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-ios` to run the app.
